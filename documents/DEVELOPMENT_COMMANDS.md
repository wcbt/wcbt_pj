# Development Commands

## Prerequisites

- Java development kit compatible with the backend and Android build
- Docker Desktop
- Android Studio and Android SDK
- PowerShell on Windows
- Git

The repository includes Maven and Gradle wrappers. Prefer the wrappers over globally installed build tools.

## Start the database

From the backend directory:

```powershell
cd backend
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

The PostgreSQL host port is defined in `backend/docker-compose.yml` and the backend properties. Use `docker compose ps` rather than relying on an old documented port.

View database-container logs:

```powershell
docker compose logs -f
```

Stop the database without removing stored data:

```powershell
docker compose stop
```

Stop and remove the containers:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

### Destructive database reset

This removes the PostgreSQL volume and causes development seed data to be recreated on the next backend start:

```powershell
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

Do not run this immediately before a demo unless a clean seed-data reset is intentional.

### Switching seed data language

The development database can be seeded with English or Traditional Chinese data. Edit `backend/src/main/resources/application-local.properties`:

```properties
app.seed.language=en  # English (default)
app.seed.language=zh  # Traditional Chinese
```

Then reset the database to apply the new language:

```powershell
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

The UI language (buttons, labels, navigation) is controlled separately through the app settings and does not depend on the seed data language. Job names, locations, and descriptions in the seed data will reflect your chosen language.

## Backend commands

From `backend/`:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean compile
```

Run backend tests:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd test
```

Start Spring Boot:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

The development backend is configured to run on:

```text
http://localhost:8081
```

Create a packaged backend build:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean package
```

## Android commands

From `CasualApp/`:

Check the Gradle wrapper:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --version
```

Current expected wrapper version:

```text
Gradle 9.4.1
```

Build the debug application:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

Clean and rebuild:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean assembleDebug
```

Run Android unit tests:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test
```

Install the debug APK on a connected emulator or device:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat installDebug
```

The debug APK is normally generated under:

```text
CasualApp/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Android-to-backend networking

### Emulator

Use this host address in Retrofit:

```text
http://10.0.2.2:8081/
```

`localhost` inside the emulator refers to the emulator itself, not the development computer.

### Physical device

The computer and phone must be on the same local network.

Find the computer address:

```powershell
ipconfig
```

Then use:

```text
http://<computer-local-ip>:8081/
```

The local IP may change between networks or router restarts.

## Endpoint smoke tests

List users:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8081/api/users
```

List jobs:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8081/api/jobs
```

Read a worker schedule:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8081/api/schedules/worker/2
```

Do not assume worker ID `2` is permanent. Check the current user response after resetting the database.

## VS Code notes

VS Code may show false Android import errors because its Java/Gradle support does not fully model Android projects. Android Studio and the Gradle build are the source of truth.

Useful VS Code commands:

```text
Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace
Developer: Reload Window
```

Suggested workspace Java settings:

```json
{
    "java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration": "automatic",
    "java.errors.incompleteClasspath.severity": "ignore",
    "java.server.launchMode": "Standard",
    "java.import.gradle.enabled": true,
    "java.compile.nullAnalysis.mode": "disabled"
}
```

## Common troubleshooting

### Backend cannot connect to PostgreSQL

1. Run `docker compose ps`.
2. Check `docker compose logs`.
3. Compare the mapped port with `application.properties` or `application-local.properties`.
4. Confirm the expected Spring profile is active.

### Android cannot reach backend

1. Confirm Spring Boot is running on port `8081`.
2. Use `10.0.2.2` for an emulator.
3. Use the computer's LAN address for a physical device.
4. Check Android cleartext/network-security configuration.
5. Check Windows Firewall if physical-device access fails.

### Changes compile in Android Studio but appear red in VS Code

Run:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean assembleDebug
```

If the build succeeds, treat VS Code highlighting as an editor-model issue.

### IDs change after database reset

Never hard-code signup, user or job IDs across the workflow. Save the IDs returned by the API response and pass those values into later approval and attendance requests.
